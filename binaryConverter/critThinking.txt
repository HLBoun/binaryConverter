Critical Thinking

Requirements:
  
  - Function receives 16-bit binary as a string
  - Function returns decimal value of the binary number
  - Call the function from a "driver" main program


First Thoughts:
  
  - I dont know what a driver program is.
  - Binary is easy (thankfully)
  - Ive encountered the string-to-integer problem many times
      before, and want to figure a good solution for this use-case.
  - I know from previous knowledge is that strings are actually just
      arrays of chars. 


Steps:
  
  0.) At the top of the paper goes my name....with the date!
  1.) Definitely need <string> and <Iostream> so go ahead and 
        lay those out, along with the main function.
  2.) Make a function that accepts input for the binary.
        Have it check size of string (for 16bit?)
  3.) Make another function that parses through the string and 
        if the string[i] is == '1' then runningTotal += powersTwo[i]
  4.) Call the function in int main()

Notes:
  
  - Apparently a driver program is just a program that demonstrates
      a function? Please correct me if i am wrong :/
